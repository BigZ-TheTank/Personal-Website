    <li>
      I started at <a href="https://www.banfield.com">Banfield Pet Hospital</a> in October 2011 as a front desk coordinator and worked my way up to becoming a manager in an offical capacity in October of 2020.</li>
    <li>
      I participated in college level courses throughout my time working at <a href="https://www.banfield.com">Banfield</a> but had a hard time balancing life, working full time, and going to classes full time.</li>
